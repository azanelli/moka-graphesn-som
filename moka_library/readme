BUILD
=====

This document gives a basic overview of the building procedure.

Requirements
============

 -- qt 4.8 or later
 -- boost 1.47.0 or later
 -- armadillo 2.4.2 or later
 -- openbabel 2.3.1 or later
 -- mlpack 1.0.1
 -- libxml2 (needed by mlpack)

How To Build
============

The following instructions assume that you have installed qmake (version 4 or
later) and make tools.

1. Install all the necessary libraries (see above).

2. Make your own libraries file:
   
   cp libraries.example libraries

3. Edit the file "libraries" with include paths of libraries installed in the 
   step 1.

4. Make and enter into directory build and run qmake:
   
   mkdir build
   cd build
   qmake ../src/moka_library.pro -r -spec linux-g++
   
5. Compile:
   
   make

6. If all went well you've just created the static library "libmoka.a".
